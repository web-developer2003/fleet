DOCUMENTATION:

-This project was created for coursework task 2 in the Web Technology module. It is not currently meant for recreational or professional use. The below app descriptions are ini a hypothetical universe where this is an actual web app for use rather than being marked.

-About the app: LimoTech is an app to help transportation companies manage their fleet, and keep their fleet in check so they're always aware of the wear and tear on their cars. By providing them with the type of car, the official car name, the year of the model, as well as the mileage on it and the driver info, owners can have a general idea of how old or new their cars are, and when its high time to renew them or add more to their fleet.

-In order to run the app locally, type "npm i nodemon", then you need to run "npm run install-all". Then, type "npm run dev" still in terminal, and now at "http://localhost:5173/" you can see the web application.

-The application dependencies of this application include, but are not limited to, bootstrap, all the packages installed for the node.js bit, and numerous other libraries references in head.pug.

-Github Repository link:

-Deployment link via Render:

-Deployment link via aws: 

-The reason I have multiple deployment links is because AWS was recommended by our lector but unfortunately if the tab isn't open running ubuntu, it seems to not be working. Just in case my computer isn't open at that time, I also have the render deployment link.

Thank you for reading my readme file, I hope the application is of some, if any, use to you :) Happy grading and have a nice day.
